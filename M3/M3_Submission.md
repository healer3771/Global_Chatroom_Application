<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>To implement the &quot;Display higher or lower as a hint after a wrong<br>guess&quot; option, I used the existing class &quot;processGuess&quot; which is basically checking whether<br>the user-written guessed number matches a randomly created number. So I just add<br>the if statement, which checks if the guessed number is smaller than the<br>randomly created number; if it is true, then it will print the hint<br>statement &quot;Your guess should be a higher number&quot; or if that is not<br>the case, just print the hint statement &quot;Your guess should be lower number&quot;.<br>And then it continues with the rest of the code.<br><br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I really enjoyed doing this code, there were some option that i thing<br>was hard but I think I will be doing that to just for<br>the fun. The second option that I choose about <span>Adding a difficulty selector<br>that adjusts the max strikes per level. I first got really confused about<br>what function or what class is doing what and which one is running<br>first. So I tried to used the debug for some reason it was<br>not working so I have to go through manually to understand all the<br>code and then I start doing work. I used option like creating new<br>class or try to done the work without creating one. This helps me<br>to understand especially when I was try to do the second option like<br>making new class using that class to recall it in another class to<br>update the different variable values. Otherwise love it. great refresher.<br></span><br></p><br></td></tr>
